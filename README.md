# 2021-Advent_of_Code
Solving Advent of Code in Python, Javascript, R, C, Java or GO

All Advent of code tasks from 2021 are stored in this repository.
I try to solve these tasks in a variety of languages to refresh and extend my personal code skills.
For each task I have created a solution approach in image form which reflects my thoughts about this task.
Additionally I linked other repositories which have solutions that interest me or I find creative.
